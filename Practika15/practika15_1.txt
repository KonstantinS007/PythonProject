You know who it is
Coming ’round again
You want a dose of this right now it’s K/DA uh!
I’m a goddess with a blade
Shout my name so you won’t forget it
Loud loud loud loud
I could take it to the top
I can never stop
I’m the best
Bad gal gal gal

And when I start to talk like that (like that)
Oh you won’t know how to react
I’m a picture perfect face
With that wild in my veins
You can hear it in my growl, growl, growl, growl

So keep your eyes on me now
You’ll like whatever you’ll see
An unreachable level
Are you sure you want a fight with me?
We gotta it all in our hands now
So can you handle what we’re all about
We’re so tough
Not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

Ain’t nobody bringing us
Down down down down down down
They could try but we’re gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round round round round round round
Wish you luck but you’re not bringing us down
We go hard till we get it get it
We go hard
We so in it in it
We POP/STARS
Only winning winning now
Ain’t nobody bringing us
Down down down down
Hey! You ready for this? Lessgo!

See, my appearance is magic anytime
I’ll take you down in one shot, my spirit never dies, uh!
Pow pow, what do you know?
You can’t handle me, even if you wanted
I can see what you want on your face
I’m trouble and you’re wanting it
I’m so cold
When I move that way
You gonna be so blown I’m the realest in the game uh!

Say I’m on fire with a blade
You’re about to hear my name
Ringing in your head like ohhh

So keep your eyes on me now
You’ll like whatever you’ll see
We’re so tough
Not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

Ain’t nobody bringing us
Down down down down down down
They could try but we’re gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round round round round round round
Wish you luck but you’re not bringing us down
